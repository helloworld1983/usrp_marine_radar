TODO
- can we do a quick mod on the LFRX board to get ability to bias input to the high speed
  ADCs? (i.e. trigger and video signals, as currently set up)
  Say, connect output of DAC_D to pin 2 (V_OCM) on the two AD813X differential
  op amps?  Currently, V_OCM is set to 3.3 V / 2 = 1.65 V via a resistor ladder
  voltage divider, but with this mod, we'd get to set V_OCM to anywhere between
  0 and +3.3 V with 12 bit resolution.  This would require adding a command to
  the firmware to allow us to set the value of DAC_D (i.e. SIGDELT), since
  AD9860/62 registers are not accessible from the FPGA.

- if so, should we send ACP and ARP via this modded LFRX and a 220 ohm resistor as
  we do for trigger

I think yes to both.  We could also get away with using one LFRX board and hook
up ACP and ARP to AUX_ADC_A1 and AUX_ADC_A2, but this would require sampling them
at high rate on the firmware side and then writing the results to new registers
on the FPGA so they could be packed into pulse metadata (which the firmware doesn't
see).  This design would be tricky and the sampling rate might really limit our
timing ability; e.g.: sampling at 1 kHz on each would give 0.14 degree precision and
sampling at 20 kHz would give 0.007 degree precision.  So maybe it is feasible.  

1 May 2012  Change to LFRX front-end board:
It appears the output resistance of the 12V heading line on Furuno radars is variable
enough and my choice of resistors for voltage dividers was close enough to the edge
case that some radars would not work with the 1K to ground line and 4.7K on input.
So I've replaced the 1K resistor with a 2K pot, and this fixes the problem for my
radar at least (Harrier).  Hopefully this board will allow Sarina to get her radar
working too.
